# Optical Drive

An optical drive is a storage device that uses laser light to read and write data on optical discs.

## Overview

Optical drives use laser technology to read data from and write data to optical media. They were once the primary method for software distribution, media playback, and data backup.

## Key Characteristics

- **Non-volatile storage**: Data persists without power
- **Removable media**: Discs can be exchanged
- **Sequential access**: Slower than direct access storage
- **Read-only or read-write**: Depending on disc type

## Common Types

| Format | Capacity | Use Case |
|--------|----------|----------|
| CD-ROM | 700 MB | Audio, software distribution |
| DVD | 4.7 GB (single layer) | Movies, software, backups |
| Blu-ray | 25 GB (single layer) | HD movies, large data archives |
| DVD-RAM | 4.7 GB | Data backup, random access |

## Types of Optical Drives

### By Functionality
- **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**: Can only read discs
- **R (Recordable)**: Write once, read many
- **RW (Rewritable)**: Write, erase, and rewrite multiple times
- **RAM**: Random access rewritable

### By Speed
Measured in multiples of base speed (1x):
- CD: 1x = 150 KB/s
- DVD: 1x = 1.35 MB/s
- Blu-ray: 1x = 4.5 MB/s

## How It Works

1. **Laser emits light** at specific wavelength (red for DVD, blue for Blu-ray)
2. **Lens focuses** the laser onto the disc surface
3. **Disc surface** has microscopic pits and lands
4. **Reflected light** is detected by photodiode
5. **Digital signal** is decoded into binary data

## Advantages

- Long archival life (10-100 years depending on quality)
- Immune to magnetic interference
- Portable and exchangeable
- Inexpensive media
- Write-once media prevents accidental deletion

## Disadvantages

- Slower than SSDs and HDDs
- Mechanical parts prone to failure
- Discs susceptible to scratches
- Limited capacity compared to modern storage
- Becoming obsolete in modern systems

## Modern Usage

- Legacy software/media access
- Archival storage
- Audio CD production
- Specific industrial/medical applications

## Comparison with Other Storage

| Feature | Optical Drive | HDD | SSD |
|---------|---------------|-----|-----|
| Speed | Slow | Medium | Fast |
| Capacity | Low-Medium | High | High |
| Durability | Fragile (discs) | Moderate | High |
| Portability | Excellent | Poor | Good |
| Cost per GB | Very Low | Low | Decreasing |
