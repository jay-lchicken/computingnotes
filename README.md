# Computing Notes

A compact, evolving set of documentation on core computing topics: operating
systems, algorithms, networks, security, and practical tooling. Each note is
written to be short, precise, and immediately useful.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

## Structure

- `docs/` holds the main notes.
- `src/pages/` includes standalone reference pages.
- `src/components/` contains homepage sections and UI.
