# Computing Notes

These notes are organized as small, focused documents on specific computing
concepts. Each document includes definitions, examples, and practical guidance
for applying the idea in real systems.

## What you will find

- Clear explanations of core concepts.
- Minimal examples you can run or adapt.
- Tradeoffs and rule-of-thumb guidance.

## Suggested path

1. Systems fundamentals: processes, memory, and I/O.
2. Algorithms: data structures and complexity.
3. Networking: protocols and distributed patterns.
4. Security: models, primitives, and secure design.
